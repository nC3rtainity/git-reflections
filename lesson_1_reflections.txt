Q. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A: Pros
	a. Don't populate the history with unnecessary versions
	b. more flexiblity as I can configure it to save automatically too
	c. Not necessary to be online
	d. Can track change across multiple files

   Cons
   	a. Might forget commit
   	b. requries a bit of time and effort to learn how to use the software and getting used to.

 Q. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 A: Git alows multi-file saving because files may be interdependent on each other. In other version control systems files like Google Docs are mostly used for files where file interdependency is very limited.

 Q. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 A: use the command git log and git diff <file_id> <file_id>

 Q. What is a git repository?

 A: A git repository is a collection of files that are tracked by git as a cohesive unit.
